# good-passwords

## 1. This project was to create a password generator with vanilla JavaScript and prompts.

## 2. HTML/JS/and CSS were all utilized to write this. (I was given starter code)

### When the page loads, the user can click the "generate password" button on the screen to begin the prompts.

### The first prompt asks the user to choose a password length between 8 and 128 characters.

### Once the user inputs a valid number and submits, a confirm box appears to allow the user to select yes/no (boolean) if they would like to use lower case, upper case, numbers, and special characters.

### Once all options are selected, a password is displayed on the page.
